# Supported Opcodes

107/107 opcodes supported (100%).

Disabled/Enabled opcodes match the current Bitcoin mainnet consensus/execution rules, such as Bitwise operations being disabled.
Soon, we hope to allow custom opcode rules through flags to enable/disable/customize allowed opcodes.

The signature used by OP_CHECKSIG must be a valid signature for this hash and public key.

| OP_CHECKMULTISIG       | 0xae      |     ✅     | Compares the first signature against each public key until it finds an ECDSA match. Starting with the subsequent public key, it compares the second signature against each remaining public key until it finds an ECDSA match. The process is repeated until all signatures have been checked or not enough public keys remain to produce a successful result. All signatures need to match a public key. If all signatures are valid, 1 is returned, 0 otherwise. Due to a bug, one extra unused value is removed from the stack. |
